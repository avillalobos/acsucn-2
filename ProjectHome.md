This is a public repository to archive all projects using or related to ACS.

## UCN - Universidad Católica del Norte ##

UCN - Universidad Católica del Norte - www.ucn.cl, university located in Antofagasta - Chile in the center of the the most awesome astronomical sky. A small group of students focus to develop projects related to computer science and software engineering most of them using ACS.

### What is ACS ###

The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is a joint project between astronomical organizations in Europe, North America, and Japan. ALMA will consist of at least 50 primary twelve meter antennas plus 4 12 meter and 12 7 meter antennas constituting the "compact array". They will be all operating in the millimeter and sub-millimeter wavelength range, with baselines up to 10 km. It will be located at an altitude above 5000m in the Chilean Atacama desert.

The ALMA Common Software (ACS) provides a software infrastructure common to all partners and consists of a documented collection of common patterns in and of components, which implement those patterns. The heart of ACS is based on a distributed component model, with ACS components implemented as CORBA objects in any of the supported programmin languages. The teams responsible for the control system's development use ACS Components as the basis for control high level entities and for the implementation of devices such as an antenna mount control.
